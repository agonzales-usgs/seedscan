 *         The FallOffQueue is a queue who's elements "fall off the end" when
 *         its maximum capacity is exceeded. This is not thread safe. We never
 *         run the risk of out of order data, but we can fail to add an element
 *         after pushing off the last element. This is a result of extending
 *         LinkedBlockingQueue.
