====    5. ScanManager

    Create a fixed thread pool (based on number of available processors)
    Add tasks to the queue
    Use thread pool to execute the tasks.

    Each task = a Scanner (A Scanner() is created for each station on list). 

    The boolean method passesFilter was used to carry the idea of filtering
    stations/networks to scan using the entire metadata station list, where
    the filters are generated from the config.xml.

    This was a Joel idea that I decided to finish implementing - not sure
    if I completely finished it.
