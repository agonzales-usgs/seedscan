====    6. Scanner

    This is really the meat of SeedScan.
    Each Scanner will scan all the requested days for a *single* station.
    Each Scanner will operate in its own thread (managed by ScanManager).

Scanner.scan() {
    Loop over days to scan
        [1] Get all the channel metadata for this station, for this day:
            StationMeta stnMeta = metaServer.getStationMeta(station, timestamp);
** Note that we actually make [2] calls to metaServer.getStationMeta() for the 
   current day timestamp (one to make sure we have stnMeta for the day,
   and another inside of getMetricData() to attach the current day stnMeta
   to the current day MetricData object

        [2] Read all miniseed files for this station, for this day (and the next
            day for event metrics that span the day):
           // Data path is specified in config.xml
            ArchivePath pathEngine = new ArchivePath(timestamp, station);
            String path pathEngine.makePath(scan.getPathPattern());
            Hashtable<String,ArrayList<DataSet>> table;
            table = splitter.doInBackground();

        [3] Loop over Metrics to compute, for this station, for this day:
            MetricData metricData = new MetricData(reader, table, stnMeta);
            for (MetricWrapper wrapper : scan.getMetrics() )
               Metric metric = wrapper.getNewInstance();
               metric.setData(metricData);
        // **  Call the metric's process() method to compute the metric:
               metric.process();
               MetricResult results = metric.getMetricResult();
               for (String id : results.getIDSet()
                    double value = results.getResult(id);
               end for
        // **  If the database is connected, try to inject the metric results just computed
               injector.inject(results);
            end Loop over Metrics

        * Note that the crossPowerMap Hashtable is passed from metric to metric so that we
          don't have to recompute the PSD for each channel - if it's already computed we
          can retrieve it and use it in a new metric.

    end Loop over days to scan
}
End Scanner
