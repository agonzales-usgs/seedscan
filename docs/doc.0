====    0. build.xml is the ant build file

   It contains several targets that you can list by doing:
   >ant -p
Buildfile: /Users/mth/mth/Projects/asl/seedscan/build.xml

        ASL SeedScan Data Quality Analyzer
    
Main targets:

 clean          clean up
 clean_build    clean up build content [del /build]
 clean_docs     clean up docs
 clean_jaxb     clean up JAXB generated sources [del dir=seedscan.config.src]
 clean_package  clean up package content
 compile        Compile the source [depends = init,jaxb]
 data           Add resource files
 docs           generate the javadoc documentation
 init           mkdir /build and /build/resources [depends = clean_build]
 jar            generate the distribution
 jaxb           JAXB class generation for config file schema [depends = clean_jaxb]
 libraries      Add libraries
 package        zips all sources and relevent files into an archive
 seedscan       Clean build + test [depends = compile, test]
 test           Run main from /build dir
Default target: compile

 The default target = compile, so:
 >ant      --> will compile
               This will activate several sub targest like clean_build, clean_jaxb, etc.
               The resulting compiled classes will be located in build/
 >ant test --> will run the (previously compiled) seedscan from the build/ dir
 >ant seedscan will compile and then run test
 >ant jar      will create SeedScan.jar
